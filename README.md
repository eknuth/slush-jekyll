> Slush scaffolding of jekyll sites

## Usage

This slush generator creates jekyll blog posts from the command line. Slush asks a few questions
and stubs out the post in ./_posts/YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD-slugified-title.md.

```bash
slush jekyll 10 Ways to Generate Code
```

## Getting Started

Install `slush-jeyll` globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g slush-jekyll
```

### Usage

Run the generator from within your blog folder:

```bash
slush jekyll
```

## Getting To Know Slush

Slush is a tool that uses Gulp for project scaffolding.

Slush does not contain anything "out of the box", except the ability to locate installed slush generators and to run them with liftoff.

To find out more about Slush, check out the [documentation](https://github.com/slushjs/slush).
